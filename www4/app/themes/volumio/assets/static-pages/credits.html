<h2>Third party links</h2>
<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may post links to third party products or services on our site.

<h2>ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS AND TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We are not responsible if information made available on this site is not accurate, complete or current. The material on this site is provided for general information only and should not be relied upon or used as the sole basis for making decisions without consulting primary, more accurate, more complete or more timely sources of information. Any reliance on the material on this site is at your own risk. </p>
<h2>PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</h2>
<p>Prices for our products and services are subject to change without notice. </p>
<p>We shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuation of our products and services. </p>
<p>We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colours and images of the products that appear in our online store. However, we cannot guarantee that your computer monitor’s display of any colour will be accurate. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to limit the sales of our products or services to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to change at any time without notice, at our sole discretion.

<h2>ACCURACY OF BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, at our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.

<p>When making purchases from Volumio, or shipping repairs to or from the customer, additional costs such as sales tax or customs duties may be imposed by local authorities. Such additional costs are the sole responsibility of the customer and not the responsibility of Volumio, nor of the shipping companies. Furthermore, we are unable to predict the applicable amount of duties and local taxes which customers may face because these costs can vary for each country and state. As a consequence, they will not be included in the checkout information or the total price charged by Volumio.

<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
